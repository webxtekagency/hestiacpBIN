# 🛠️ System Garbage Cleaner (`clean-garbage`)

*A simple housekeeper script. It safely deletes old unneeded system logs, temporary server files, and frozen spam emails to free up large amounts of disk space on your server.*

---

## 🚀 1. How to Install (The Easy Way)
Instead of copying files manually, use the module installer to place the script and default config. To add the recommended schedule, run the repository root installer with `--setup-crons`.
```bash
cd /root/hestiacp-useful-tools/scripts/clean-garbage
bash install.sh
```

## 📂 2. File Paths (Where is everything?)
If you want to look at the files, here is exactly where the installer places them:
* **The Executable Script:** `/usr/local/hestia/bin/v-clean-garbage`
* **The Configuration File:** `/etc/hestiacp-clean-garbage.conf`

## ⚙️ 3. How to Configure
By default, the script will safely clean logs older than 7 days. If you want to change this behavior:

1. Open `/etc/hestiacp-clean-garbage.conf` in your editor (e.g. `nano /etc/hestiacp-clean-garbage.conf`).
2. Change the variables you want. For example, to keep logs for 30 days instead of 7, change `JOURNALCTL_RETENTION_DAYS=7` to `JOURNALCTL_RETENTION_DAYS=30`.
3. Save the file. The cleanup script will automatically read this file the next time it runs!

## ⛔ 4. Crucial Rules (What NOT to do)
* **DO NOT** edit the `.sh` executable file directly. Your changes will be wiped on the next update! Always edit the `.conf` file in `/etc/`.
* **DO NOT** change the permissions of the executable. It must remain `755` (rwxr-xr-x) and owned by `root:root` to function correctly inside Hestia.
* **DO NOT** run this script manually as a normal user. It must be executed as `root` or it won't have permission to clean system logs.

## 🔬 Advanced Architecture Notes (Geeks Only)

### Features under the hood
*   **System Logs:** Cleans old `journalctl` logs, rotated logs, and orphaned temp files.
*   **Service Logs:** Truncates and safely rotates logs for Nginx, Apache, Exim, Dovecot, MySQL, PHP-FPM without restarting the services.
*   **Mail Queue:** Eradicates old frozen Exim emails and spam.
*   **Trash:** Empties user trash bins older than configured days via Hestia CLI.
*   **Database:** Purges MySQL slow query logs natively.
*   **Smart Safety:** Employs `lsof` to ensure files aren't locked before deleting them.

### Concurrency & Crash Safety
- Written with `set -o pipefail` for safer pipe error handling.
- Uses atomic `flock` filesystem locks instead of fragile `pidof` to prevent double-execution.
- Injects a `trap ERR` listener that guarantees an administrative email alert if the cleanup process violently crashes mid-execution.
