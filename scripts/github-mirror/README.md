# 🛠️ GitHub Mirror (`github-mirror`)

*Automatically pushes and clones private GitHub/GitLab repositories straight into your HestiaCP server. Perfect for keeping static sites (like Astro or React) automatically synced to your server for local backups.*

## 🚀 1. How to Install (The Easy Way)
Instead of copying files manually, use the module installer to place the script and default configs. To add the recommended sync schedule, run the repository root installer with `--setup-crons`.
```bash
cd /root/hestiacp-useful-tools/scripts/github-mirror
bash install.sh
```

## 📂 2. File Paths (Where is everything?)
If you want to look at the files, here is exactly where the installer places them:
* **The Executable Script:** `/usr/local/hestia/bin/v-github-mirror`
* **The Target URLs List:** `/etc/hestiacp-github-mirror.conf` (Where you put your GitHub links)
* **The Settings File:** `/etc/hestiacp-github-mirror.settings` (Where you set Emails)

## ⚙️ 3. How to Configure
You need to tell the script WHICH repositories to clone and to WHICH user's folder.

1. Open `/etc/hestiacp-github-mirror.conf` in your editor (`nano /etc/hestiacp-github-mirror.conf`).
2. Add your repositories using this dummy-proof format divided by `|` pipes:
   `username|git@github.com:your-name/your-repo.git|main|web/domain.com/public_html|overwrite`
   *(This tells it: For Hestia user "username", clone that repo, using branch "main", into that folder, and "overwrite" it).*
3. Save the file.
4. **Important!** Since it's a private repo, you must go to GitHub -> Repository Settings -> Deploy Keys, and add your Server's Root SSH public key. (To get the key, type: `cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`).

## ⛔ 4. Crucial Rules (What NOT to do)
* **DO NOT** edit the `.sh` executable file directly. Your changes will be wiped on the next update! Always edit the `.conf` file in `/etc/`.
* **DO NOT** change the permissions of the executable. It must remain `755` (rwxr-xr-x) and owned by `root:root` to function correctly inside Hestia.
* **DO NOT** use HTTPS urls if your repo is private. Always use SSH URLs (`git@github.com:...`).
* **DO NOT** run this script as a normal user. It must be executed as `root`.

## 🔬 Advanced Architecture Notes (Geeks Only)

### Features under the hood
*   **Secure Permissions:** Automatically fixes file ownership (`chown user:user`) after pulling so HestiaCP doesn't break.
*   **Flexible Retention:** Choose between **Overwrite** (incremental git mirror) or **Versioned** (keeps the last 5 pull versions separately).
*   **Email Alerts:** Sends an HTML Server log to the Admin via Exim if a git clone/pull fails.

### CLI Testing Commands
You can test the module without activating the cron loop:
* `/usr/local/hestia/bin/v-github-mirror` (Runs the sync engine)
* `/usr/local/hestia/bin/v-github-mirror --test-email` (Sends a fake crash alert to verify your SMTP config)
* `/usr/local/hestia/bin/v-github-mirror --force-notification` (Useful to hook up to a weekly cron to receive heartbeat status emails)

### Security & Sanitization
- Replaced `eval echo "~$user"` with `getent passwd "$user"` to definitively eliminate bash command injection risks if the configuration file is contaminated.
- Replaced pipeline `ls -d | sort` with `find -print0 | sort -z` to safely handle repositories with exotic file names and spaces.
- Bound by `set -o pipefail` and `trap ERR` to email crashes.
