## 🛠️ Available Modules

Click on any module below to read its dedicated dummy-proof guide:

### 1. [clean-garbage](./clean-garbage/)
A housekeeper script. It safely deletes old logs, temp files, and spam emails to free up disk space on your server.

### 2. [backup-core-patches](./backup-core-patches/)
Upgrades the native HestiaCP backup engine. Automatically organizes your server backups into clean Yearly/Monthly folders (`YYYY/MM`), repairs corrupted databases before exporting them, sends modern Dark-Mode HTML emails instead of plain text, and patches `v-backup-users` with an optional dry-run-first retention hook for classic `.tar` backups.

### 3. [exim-limit](./exim-limit/)
A spam protector. Automatically blocks any outgoing emails larger than 10MB to prevent your server from being blacklisted by Google or Microsoft.

### 4. [fix-web-permissions](./fix-web-permissions/)
**⚠️ Powerful Tool:** Natively fixes broken `public_html` file ownerships (usually caused by FTP uploads) and hardens your WordPress/CMS security against hackers.

### 5. [security-audit](./security-audit/)
**⚠️ Powerful Tool:** A deep security scanner. Sweeps your server for Malware, vulnerabilities, open ports, and weak passwords, generating an "A to F" graded security report.

### 6. [system-report](./system-report/)
Sends you a beautiful HTML email report every morning showing your Server RAM, CPU usage, Disk Space, and service health.

### 7. [github-mirror](./github-mirror/)
Automates the cloning and syncing of your private GitHub repositories down to your server folders.

### 8. [logrotate-optimize](./logrotate-optimize/)
Upgrades Apache & Nginx log rotation from weekly to daily (14 days compressed). Prevents single domain logs from growing to 100MB+ during ad campaigns or brute-force attacks.
